# How to set up Selenium with Python:
------------------------


**Step 1: Install Python**

First, you need to have Python installed on your machine. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Step 2: Install pip**

Pip is a package manager for Python. It's used to install and manage Python packages. If you installed Python from the official website, pip should have been installed automatically. If not, you can install pip using the following command in your terminal:

For Unix/macOS:

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

For Windows, download `get-pip.py` from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py, then run:

```bash
python get-pip.py
```

**Step 3: Install Selenium**

Once you have pip installed, you can use it to install Selenium. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

**Step 4: Check Chrome Version**

Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. ChromeDriver is the WebDriver for Chrome and is needed to run tests in Chrome. You need to download the ChromeDriver version that matches the version of Chrome installed on your machine. 

To check your Chrome version:

1. Open Chrome.
2. Click on the three dots in the top right corner.
3. Go to "Help" -> "About Google Chrome".
4. Here, you can see the version of your Chrome browser.

**Step 5: Download ChromeDriver**

After you've identified your Chrome version, you can download the corresponding ChromeDriver from the ChromeDriver download page: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

**Step 6: Add ChromeDriver to System Path**

After downloading the ChromeDriver, you need to add it to your system's PATH. 

For Unix/macOS:

1. Move the downloaded `chromedriver` to `/usr/local/bin` directory (or any directory in your system PATH).
2. Make it executable using the command: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver`

For Windows:

1. Extract the downloaded `chromedriver.exe` file.
2. Add the directory containing `chromedriver.exe` to the System PATH.
3. You can do this by opening System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables, then editing the PATH variable to include the path of your `chromedriver.exe`.

Now, you should be all set to use Selenium with Python!
