# Python Setup:
------------------------


**Step 1: Install Python**

First, you need to have Python installed on your machine. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Step 2: Install pip**

Pip is a package manager for Python. It's used to install and manage Python packages. If you installed Python from the official website, pip should have been installed automatically. If not, you can install pip using the following command in your terminal:

For Unix/macOS:

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

For Windows, download `get-pip.py` from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py, then run:

```bash
python get-pip.py
```
